# Fundamentals of Deep Learning 
Workshop covered fundamentals on:
1. PyTorch
2. Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Data Augmentation
4. Transfer Learning 
5. Natural Language Processing

______

## Things I've got to try:
- Training a computer vision model to learn the process of training
- CNN Introduction to improve Accuracies
- Data augmentation techniques to enhance a dataset andn improve a model
- Use pre trained models to solve deep learning challenges quicker
- Train RNN's on sequential data
- Use a pretrained image calssificaation model to creation
- Leverage transfer learning to create more.
- LLM integration to answer questions on exercise

___

## My final project:
- Goal: Create and train a model that inteprets between fresh and rotten fruit

#### What I learned:
  - Data generation and augmentation from small datasets
  - Application of transfer learning and feature extraction to increase speed
  - Hands on experience with Deep Learning via different projects helped me figure out these concepts in a more realistic way.
